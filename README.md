# explorer-game
a simple planet exploration game with pseudorandomly generated worlds (Java)

## mechanics
The player uses WASD to move across a world with different locations/tile features. The player can encounter pseudorandom events like alien fights, NPC dialogue, or teleportation. The game ends when the player dies (runs out of health). Saving/loading are possible with the Q (quit) and L (load) keys.
